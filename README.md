# The Project
The Rest Cars project provides Project Cars 2 Shared Memory Data via JSON over HTTP. The native windows command prompt application will act as a local webserver that provides the data over HTTP. Any HTTP client or web browser is able to access data provided by the API.

For future implementation of functions you can take a look at the waffle board:
