# The Project
The Rest Cars project provides Project Cars 2 Shared Memory Data via JSON over HTTP. The native windows command prompt application will act as a local webserver that provides the data over HTTP. Any HTTP client or web browser is able to access data provided by the API.

The application is mainly written in C++ and uses a embedded web server called mongoose (https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose).

# Stream overlays

Aside from the REST API i work on a bunch of useful stream overlays for stream applications such as OBS and XSplit: 
* track map with current participiant positions
* participiant listing with standings and relative positions
* clutch and brake overlay
* steering overlay with exchangable wheel images

They are managed in an seperated repository: [Rest Cars Overlays](https://github.com/i12bokay/rest-cars-overlays)
